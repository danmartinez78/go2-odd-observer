  - Warehouse AMR (floor type, shelf proximity, charging)
- [ ] Code templates
  - Agent instruction templates for different domains
  - Tool function patterns for custom sensors
  - Distance metric customization

### 4. Kaggle Capstone Evaluation Alignment
**Review competition rubric and maximize points**

- [ ] Review official evaluation criteria
  - Technical depth and innovation
  - Code quality and documentation
  - Real-world applicability
  - Presentation quality
- [ ] Identify point-earning opportunities
  - Novel contributions (multi-agent ODD analysis)
  - Comprehensive documentation
  - Reproducibility (demo data, clear setup)
  - Professional presentation
- [ ] Add missing features based on rubric
  - Quantitative evaluation metrics
  - Comparison with baseline approaches
  - Failure case analysis
  - Future work roadmap

### 5. Final Report Preparation
**According to Kaggle capstone guidelines**

- [ ] Executive Summary
  - Problem statement and motivation
  - Approach overview
  - Key results and contributions
- [ ] Technical Sections
  - Architecture deep dive
  - Agent design patterns
  - Multi-modal sensor fusion
  - ODD formalization and distance metrics
- [ ] Evaluation and Results
  - Test scenarios and datasets
  - Performance metrics
  - Comparison with manual analysis
  - Error analysis
- [ ] Documentation Quality
  - Clear diagrams (architecture, data flow)
  - Code examples with explanations
  - API reference
  - Troubleshooting guide

### 6. Demo Artifacts Creation
**Video and interactive demonstrations**

- [ ] Screen recording video (5-10 minutes)
  - Introduction and problem context
  - Live workflow demonstration
  - Results visualization and interpretation
  - Key takeaways
- [ ] Jupyter notebook walkthrough
  - Step-by-step execution
  - Inline explanations and visualizations
  - Interactive parameter tuning
- [ ] Static demo materials
  - Architecture diagrams
  - Sample reports (PDF/HTML)
  - Before/after comparisons
- [ ] GitHub README showcase
  - Badges (tests, docs, license)
  - GIF demonstrations
  - Quick start guide
  - Links to video and docs

## Backlog / Nice-to-Have

- [ ] Web interface for non-technical users
- [ ] Automated report generation pipeline (executive summary export)
- [ ] Real-time monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Historical trend analysis across deployments
- [ ] Compliance certification export (PDF report)
- [ ] Meta-analysis tools for comparing batch runs
- [ ] Fix nav2/localization on Go2 robot to enable odometry-based velocity analysis
  - Current state: odometry data unreliable (all zeros in real robot bags)
  - Impact: Currently using acceleration-based ODD metrics (max_accel_mps2)
  - Future: Could add speed-based analysis alongside acceleration if odometry fixed
  - Priority: LOW - current acceleration metrics work well for control validation

## Technical Debt

- [x] Validate test data generation scripts match current workflow ✅ DONE
- [x] Consolidate test fixtures ✅ DONE
- [ ] Add type hints to remaining functions
- [ ] Improve error messages and logging consistency
- [ ] Consider removing old `odd_cod/` module if unused
